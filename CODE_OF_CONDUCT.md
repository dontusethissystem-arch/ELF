# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers commit to making participation in this project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful in speech and actions
- Accepting constructive criticism gracefully
- Showing courtesy and respect in interactions

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Harassing, intimidating, or discriminatory comments or actions
- Excessive use of profanity targeted at individuals
- Personal insults, including those related to protected classes
- Public or private harassment, stalking, or sustained disruption of discussions
- Posting sexually explicit images in public spaces

## Responsibilities of Project Maintainers

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by opening an issue in this repository or contacting the maintainers. To report:

1. Open an issue at: https://github.com/dontusethissystem-arch/ELF/issues
2. Title the issue "Code of Conduct Report" and provide:
   - A short description of the incident
   - Date, time, and any relevant links
   - Names or handles of involved parties (if known)
   - Any supporting evidence (screenshots, logs, etc.)
3. If you prefer to report privately and you have a contact email for maintainers, please use that; otherwise use the issue tracker and mark the report as confidential in the description and maintainers will follow up.

All reports will be handled with discretion to the extent possible and with timely follow-up.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team, who will determine appropriate action at their discretion. Consequences may range from a private warning to removal from the project, depending on the severity and frequency of the behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual's actions are connected to project activities, including but not limited to public repositories, issue trackers, chat rooms, mailing lists, and social media used to discuss the project.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org
