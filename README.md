# ELF

A compact, focused repository for working with ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) binaries — tooling, libraries, examples, and utilities for inspecting, parsing, and manipulating ELF files.

This README is intentionally pragmatic. If something below doesn't match the repository contents, update the sections marked TODO to reflect the actual implementation language, build system, and usage.

## Overview

ELF contains tools and libraries to inspect or operate on ELF binaries. Typical use-cases include:

- Reading ELF headers and sections
- Disassembling or dumping symbols and relocations
- Performing lightweight manipulation (e.g., stripping, editing section names)
- Educational examples demonstrating ELF internals

If this repository hosts a library, the library exposes an API for reading/parsing ELF structures; if it's a CLI toolset, it provides commands for common ELF operations.

## Features

- Parse ELF headers and program/section headers
- List symbols, imports/exports, and relocations
- Dump segments and raw section contents
- (Optional) Modify metadata or perform safe edits
- Small, well-documented examples demonstrating usage

## Quickstart

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/dontusethissystem-arch/ELF.git
   cd ELF

2. Build (see "Building from source" below for exact steps).

3. Run the provided CLI or examples. Typical commands:
   - List headers:
     ./bin/elftool headers /path/to/binary
   - List symbols:
     ./bin/elftool symbols /path/to/binary
   - Dump a section:
     ./bin/elftool dump-section .text /path/to/binary > text.bin

(Replace `./bin/elftool` with the actual binary name after build — see project-specific build instructions below.)

## Examples

- Inspect an ELF file:
  ./bin/elftool inspect /usr/bin/ls

- Extract the .rodata section:
  ./bin/elftool dump-section .rodata /path/to/binary > rodata.bin

- Programmatic usage (pseudocode — adapt to your language binding):
  const elf = ELF.parse(fs.readFileSync('a.out'));
  console.log(elf.headers);
  for (const sym of elf.symbols) console.log(sym.name, sym.addr);

Replace the above with the real API calls for the language used in this repo.

## Building from source

The project may be implemented in one of several languages. Use the section that applies and update TODOs.

- Generic prerequisites
  - Git
  - A compiler or runtime for the project's language (C/C++, Rust, Go, Python, etc.)
  - Make/CMake or the language's build tool

- C / C++
  - Requirements: gcc/clang, make, cmake (if applicable)
  - Build:
    mkdir -p build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    # Binary output will be in build/bin or similar

- Go
  - Requirements: Go 1.18+
  - Build:
    go build -o bin/elftool ./cmd/elftool

- Rust
  - Requirements: rustup + cargo
  - Build:
    cargo build --release
    # Binary in target/release/

- Python
  - Requirements: Python 3.8+
  - Install:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
  - Run examples:
    python examples/inspect.py /path/to/binary

If this repository uses a different build system, replace the above instructions with the correct commands.

## Tests

- Run unit tests (adapt to language)
  - C/C++: run tests in build/ or use make test
  - Go: go test ./...
  - Rust: cargo test
  - Python: pytest

Add or update test commands to reflect the actual test framework present in the repo.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome.

- Fork the repo
- Create a feature branch: git checkout -b feat/my-feature
- Add tests for new functionality
- Submit a pull request describing:
  - What the change does
  - Why it's needed
  - Any compatibility/migration notes

Please follow the repository's code style and include tests where applicable. If there's a CONTRIBUTING.md in this repository, follow that instead.

## Code of Conduct

This project follows a standard code of conduct. Be respectful, and open a discussion or issue if you encounter problems. Add or link a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md in the repo if one exists.

## License

See LICENSE in the repository root for license terms. If no license file exists, default to "All rights reserved" — add a permissive license (MIT/Apache/BSD) if you intend to allow reuse.

Notes for repository owner: Update the TODO sections above to reflect the actual implementation language, CLI names, build steps, and API examples. If you want, I can fetch the repository files and generate a README that includes exact build and usage commands tailored to the codebase — say "fetch repo contents" and I'll inspect the tree and produce a more precise README.
